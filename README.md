# Portfolio Website

Overview
---
This is my personal website that I use to keep track of my projects and experiences. [Check it out](www.henrygridley.me) to see what I've been up to.

Frontend
---
When I first started making this site, I had little web experience and a lot of time so I did it all myself using HTML and CSS. Now, I have a little more web experience, a lot less time, and the realization that I'm not the best at design so I'm using Bootstrap templates with a few tweaks here and there.

Backend
---
The site is built using the Django web framework and is hosted on Heroku. I also set it up so that it I can easily update it using admin pages, which should hopefully mean the information is always mostly up to date.
