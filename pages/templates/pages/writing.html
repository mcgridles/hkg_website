        <p class="writing">
            This semester we have learned about the importance of writing within the discipline of engineering; without it, communicating effectively would be very difficult. Ideas could not be shared, and work would not get done. Furthermore, I have come to the conclusion that the way information is presented is often more important than what the information being presented actually is. If writing is not accessible to the right audience, readers will not be receptive to any ideas, nor will they understand them. Through this lens I believe I have made notable growth in improving my understanding of how writing is used to accomplish different tasks, and how to examine such writing.
        </p>
        <p class="writing">
	      Beginning with the first paper, I thought I had a decent grasp on how to examine a piece of technical writing and gain an understanding of the topic, but I found I didn’t know exactly what methods the author or authors were using to present the information in an accessible way. Through my reading of “Deep Learning”; a review written by Yann LeCun, Yoshua Bengio, and Geoffrey Hinton; I began to see how they used visual elements and a focus on why deep learning is important, as opposed to how it works, to present some technical information without overwhelming the reader. Regardless of what the topic is, it is a far more palatable way for information to be conveyed. While I had not thought too much before about the correct way to do this, Michael Fialkoff states in a revision comment that I “have several strong claims that are backed up with evidence from the article [I] read,” showing I was able to grasp the concept relatively well. However, I did struggle with sentence length and structure some in this paper, so there are still improvements that can be made.
        </p>
        <p class="writing">
          After examining methods of discourse in unit one, I thought creating a reference document would be much easier. However, I had never really thought about how to present information visually in such a condensed way. Something like an Ikea instruction manual for instance takes an incredible understanding of both the topic and the audience. My initial idea was to create a reference document detailing the up-and-coming tech industry in the Midwest. Unfortunately, I was never able to produce something that I felt accurately conveyed the information in a useful and interesting way. This was quite frustrating because, being from the Midwest, it is something I care a lot about and thought it would be a good way to share that with others. Thankfully, I was able to pivot and create a reference document for the E-Board members of the club swim team instead. It describes what each officer needs to keep track of and be worried about throughout the semester and provides some guidance on how to perform tasks. One thing the document does not do though, is go into great detail about any specific task. That is because it is meant to be a summary of each position and if I include every minute detail, no one would want to read it, rendering it useless. After examining other reference documents, I realized it is important to have something that is brief enough that it can be referenced quickly, and it does not deter those who may need it. I still was not able to condense the information as much as a more visual document may have, but I think I was able to structure it well enough that it can serve its purpose.
        </p>
        <p class="writing">
          Following my difficulties with the reference document, I found writing an op-ed to be much easier. I did struggle somewhat with presenting technical information to a non-technical audience, but I found while reading other articles such as the Wired article “A Brief History of Autonomous Vehicle Technology” that the key is to discuss only what is immediately critical for understanding. If equations and technical jargon do not add to the comprehension of the topic, they are not useful in the article. Otherwise, the ideas can be lost on the audience regardless of what those ideas are. I also enjoyed this paper more because it gave me a chance to write about a topic that really interests me, autonomous vehicles. The op-ed/explainer form also allowed me to explore my interests a little more without having to worry about rigid guidelines. I think my enjoyment of the topic and article format show in my writing and result in a much better paper.
        </p>
        <p class="writing">
          In contrast to the loose form of the op-ed, writing a literary review was much more structured which at times presented challenges for me in my writing. However, it did feel like a culmination of all previous assignments; I had to make judgement calls and use the proper writing methods to back those judgements up with concrete analysis, I had to present detailed technical information for readers in my discipline, and because it was a literary review it was important that I still make it accessible to readers with less experience with the topic. I struggled with this because regardless of what topic I chose to write about, it needed to be presented in a manner that would convey the necessary technical details but not be so overwhelming that no one could read it, similarly to the reference document. I especially found it hard to digest and condense the technical information because there were so many research papers and each one was very technical, as they should be. However, Julia Piraino commented that I wrote a “very polished draft with great integration of figures and clear, logical judgments,” so I think I may have gotten closer than I’m willing to give myself credit for.
        </p>
        <p class="writing">
          Overall, I think I did well in this course and showed off some of my skills as a writer. Even more importantly, I learned so much about the ways writing is used in my discipline, from specific technical information conveyed through images and other forms for colleagues in my field, to how to present a topic to a less experienced audience when necessary. These are both incredibly important in writing because even a simple topic will be hard to understand if the proper methods are not used to construct a clear and concise argument. I have no doubt that I will need to write technical reports for colleagues and managers during my career, and I will probably even have to present my ideas to someone who does not have the technical background I do. I hope to one day end up as a technical lead on a project, and based on previous work experience, I know this will almost certainly involve proposals, reports, and lots of emails with supervisors and colleagues. Whether it be a research proposal, an article, or a letter it’s important to be able to write to a diverse audience and while I am far from perfect, I think I gained a much better understanding over the course of the semester on how to do that.

        <p class="writing">
            I would like to thank my classmates for taking the time to read and review each of my papers. Without their patience and help, it is likely my papers would be unreadable. I would also like to thank Professor Tom Akbari, who not only made class lighthearted and fun, but also taught me a lot about examining ideas and writing in the world around me. He made showing up to class much more enjoyable, and without him I would have learned a whole lot less.
